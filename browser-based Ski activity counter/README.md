# Redux is a JavaScript library for managing client data in apps. <br />
You can use Redux together with React or with any other view library. <br />
Inspired by Flux, Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen. <br />
It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), <br />
and are easy to understand and debug.<br />
